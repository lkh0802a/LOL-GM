# LOL GM — Development Guide

## Current Phase

`CURRENT_PHASE = PHASE_1_CORE_GAME`

The Artifact migration is complete and accepted. GitHub is now the primary development codebase.

Current Phase 1 goal: replace prototype-only state with coherent persistent game state and complete the first real gameplay loop:

`New Game → Team Selection → World Creation → Date Progression → Schedule → Draft → Match → Result/Stats → Standings → Continue Season`

Use `docs/POST_ARTIFACT_ROADMAP.md` for implementation order and `docs/CORE_DOMAIN_MODEL.md` as an architectural guardrail.

## Phase 0 migration record

The completed Artifact migration preserved these requirements:

- preserve visual/behavioral parity before large refactors
- establish a real app entry point and routing
- make install/dev/build commands work
- keep mock data explicit and replaceable
- introduce stable IDs where needed
- establish application-state and domain boundaries without overengineering
- keep simulation logic out of React/UI components
- verify smartphone portrait behavior
- leave the repository understandable to the next AI

Do not use Phase 0 as an excuse to implement the entire master specification.

## Phase 0 exit criteria

Phase 0 can end when all of the following are true:

- the approved Artifact's core UI/UX is present in the repository
- the app installs and runs from the repository
- a production build succeeds
- core navigation/routes work
- key mobile layouts remain intact
- obvious runtime/import/asset errors are resolved
- mock data is identifiable and replaceable
- stable entity IDs are not replaced by display-name references
- future domain/engine code can be added without being embedded in screen components

These criteria were accepted on 2026-09-26. See `docs/PHASE_0_REVIEW.md`.

Phase 1 is active.

## Planned boundaries

```text
src/
├─ app/          # routes, app shell, providers, navigation
├─ artifact/     # optional temporary landing zone during migration only
├─ components/   # reusable presentation extracted from Artifact
├─ features/     # screen/feature modules
├─ stores/       # application/game state
├─ types/        # shared domain contracts
├─ engine/       # UI-independent game/simulation logic
├─ data/         # mock/initial/config data
└─ utils/
```

Directories do not need to exist until code requires them.

## Core separation

```text
Artifact / UI / Features
          ↓
Application State / Services
          ↓
Domain + Simulation Engine
          ↓
World Data / Rules / Config
```

UI must never become the source of truth for simulation rules.

Examples:

- match screens display simulation outcomes; they do not decide winners
- draft screens issue actions; draft/domain logic validates legality
- standings screens display tables; league logic calculates them
- player screens display growth; development systems calculate it

## Phase 0 mock rule

Artifact mock data is allowed and expected.

However:

- identify mock data clearly
- keep it replaceable
- avoid spreading duplicate mock objects across unrelated components
- use stable IDs
- do not treat prototype schemas as final domain schemas automatically
- do not fake completed simulation systems

## What happens after Artifact import

The first integration pass prioritizes **visual and behavioral parity**.

After parity and build stability:

1. analyze the migrated codebase
2. remove only migration-specific duplication/technical debt that blocks progress
3. adopt stable common models
4. introduce real game state
5. build the first playable season loop in small vertical slices

Do not perform a large rewrite merely to match a preferred architecture.

See:

- `docs/POST_ARTIFACT_ROADMAP.md`
- `docs/CORE_DOMAIN_MODEL.md`

## Future compatibility

The architecture must leave room for:

- real calendar progression
- roster registration
- draft engine
- match engine
- statistics
- league rules
- contracts/transfers
- scouting/development
- reserves
- finance/facilities
- worldwide AI simulation
- patches/meta
- international tournaments
- persistent saves

These systems are not Phase 0 implementation requirements.

## Shared AI development workflow

LOL GM is currently developed primarily by **ChatGPT in this GitHub codebase**.

The repository and canonical docs are the project state. Future external AI assistance, if used, must treat the repository as the handoff surface.

For every substantial task:

1. sync understanding from the latest repository state
2. inspect existing implementation before writing a replacement
3. follow the current phase and canonical specification
4. integrate with existing repository work
5. leave code and documentation understandable to the next assistant
6. prefer one shared implementation over parallel alternatives
7. verify the change instead of reporting completion from code edits alone

The user is the game/product director and tester, not the manual integration layer. The user should not need to edit UI/UX, code, CSS, Git files or build configuration when an AI can perform the work.

The intended loop is:

`User direction → AI implementation → GitHub → runnable build → user playtest → feedback → next iteration`

See `docs/LOL_GM_SPEC.md#43-chatgpt--claude-collaborative-development-workflow` for the full collaboration contract.
